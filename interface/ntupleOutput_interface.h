/*
 * Useful info
 *
 * TNtuple is:
 *   branches of Float_t parameters, named somehow
 *
 * TTree is:
 *   branches of simple Float_t, Int_t parameters or complex classes, known to ROOT
 *   (new classes are given to ROOT by call gROOT->ProcessLine("#include <vector>"))
 *   the creation method for these 2 types is different,
 *   also these methods are different from from TNtuple ones (in better way)
 *
 */

/*
 * What is wanted:
 *   keep the output TTree interface (i.e. the definitions of Branches, their classes and names) in 1 file
 *   easily create or open TTree of this interface in main process
 *   loop over Entires
 *   and have full access to all the branches
 *
 * To do it:
 *   there are macro creating this interface
 *   and the list of them with current definition of the interface is in this file
 *   there are 2 bunches of macro -- for creating Branches of new TTree or for opening existing one
 *   which unfold into commands like
 *      Class_X NT_branchFoo; outputTTreeObject.Branch("branchFoo", "Class_X", &NT_branchFoo);
 *      or
 *      Class_X NT_branchFoo; outputTTreeObject.SetBranchAddress("branchFoo", &NT_branchFoo);
 *
 * the outputTTreeObject is defined in OUTNTUPLE
 * the mode of the interface (create or open ttree) is defined with NTUPLE_INTERFACE_CREATE or NTUPLE_INTERFACE_OPEN
 *
 * there are also a bunch of convenience macro for handling the TNtuple legacy bunches of Float_t parameters
 * -- they mostly should go away when propper objects are used
 *  and there is a macro reseting all the branch parameters -- it's ad-hoc, TODO: do it somehow in more automated, convenient way
 *
 * branch object names are prepended with NT_
 * so a branch named "foo" in the program namespace will have the object named NT_foo
 *
 * also default name of the TTree is NT_output_ttree
 *
 * there is a usage example in a comment further

/*
 * this file ties the interface to our ntuple (TTree) in the current namespace
 *
 * Usage
 * 
 * actual files using it are:
 *   bin/ntupleEvents.cc           (creates the TTree, at line 1542 in main)
 *   test/likelihood_regions.cc    (uses existing TTree, at line 51 in pull_likelihood_regions)
 *
 * Roughly the idea is as follows
 *
 * declare your ntuple:
 *
 *     TTree output("reduced_ttree", "TTree with reduced event data");
 *     // if the name is not `NT_output_ttree` (which is assumed here in the interface)
 *     // define your name for preprocessor:
 *     #define OUTNTUPLE output
 *
 *     // set the mode of the interface to branches (create branches in a new TTree or open branches of existing TTree):
 *     #define NTUPLE_INTERFACE_CREATE
 * 
 *     // load this interface:
 *     #include "ntupleOutput.h"
 *
 * now you have NT_Name objects in the name space and the ntuple has branches "Name" with pointers to these objects
 * you can loop over TTree:
 *
 *     for (Long64_t i=0; i<NT_output_ttree.GetEntries(); i++)
 *         {
 *         NT_output_ttree.GetEntry(i);
 *         ...
 *         }
 *
 * copy objects from event (pseudocode):
 *
 *     NT_foo = events[i]["foo"])
 *
 * or actual example from ntupleEvents:
 *     NT_aMCatNLO_weight = evt->weight();
 * or from likelihood_regions:
 *     if (NT_tau_IDlev_0 != 3. && NT_tau_IDlev_1 != 3.) continue;
 *     
 * when done fill the ntuple:
 *
 *     output.Fill();
 *
 * clearing/reseting of the objects for each event -- currently it is responsibility of the programmer
 * but there is a sketchy macro for this now, it is in development
 * used as in ntupleEvents:
 *     RESET_NTUPLE_PARAMETERS // defaults all parameters
 *
 * -- with no ;
 * that's how sketchy it is
 *
